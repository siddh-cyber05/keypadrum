# 🎧 Keypad Drum

A simple web-based drum kit that turns your keyboard into a percussion instrument! Press keys **A to L** to play drum sounds and enjoy a rhythmic experience right in the browser.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Keypad Drum transforms your keyboard into a **drum pad**. When you press keys from **A to L**, corresponding drum sounds play instantly — just like tapping on musical pads.  
This project is great for learning JavaScript keyboard events and working with audio in the browser.

## 🎹 How It Works

- **HTML** defines the visual layout of keys  
- **CSS** styles the drum pads and adds animations

- Each key is linked to an audio file using a `data-key` attribute
